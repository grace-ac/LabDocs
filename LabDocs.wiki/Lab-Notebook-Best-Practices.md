We have been using online lab notebooks since 2007 and the platforms and workflows have certainly changed over the years. Below is a compendium of best practices based on our experience and the particular research we do. This is intended for those in our lab group, however [comments and suggestions are welcome](https://github.com/sr320/LabDocs/issues/new). 


## Select an appropriate platform
For most, Wordpress is recommended ie
* http://onsnetwork.org/
* http://safsoa.wordpress.com/
* http://genefish.wordpress.com/

## Make sure it is reproducible
Document in a fashion where someone could replicate your work

## Document daily
A record of your work should be published the day of activity.

## Maintain backup
Have a copy of your notebook in another location. This could be done in several ways.
- composing in text editor and hosting on GitHub
- using IFTTT to post/save entries elsewhere
- run script (ie wget) to archive contents
