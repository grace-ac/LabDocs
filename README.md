LabDocs
=======

This is a dynamic respository, and ~~soon to be~~ the jumping off place, for finding [our own](http://faculty.washington.edu/sr320/) stuff on the web. The current highlights include 

* [Useful code and scripts](https://github.com/sr320/LabDocs/tree/master/code)
* [Proposal Database](https://github.com/sr320/LabDocs/blob/master/Proposal_database.md)
* [Next-Gen Sequencing Data Management Plan](https://github.com/sr320/LabDocs/blob/master/DMPseq.md)

We will be using the [wiki](https://github.com/sr320/LabDocs/wiki) to migrate active, canonical [protocols](http://genefish.wikispaces.com/protocols) and [procedures](http://genefish.wikispaces.com/How-to) from genefish.wikispaces.com    
Highlights

* [Common Lab Protocols](https://github.com/sr320/LabDocs/wiki/Common-Lab-Protocols)
* [NAS Infrastructure](https://github.com/sr320/LabDocs/wiki/Network-Attached-Storage-Infrastructure)

The [![issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/sr320/LabDocs.svg)](https://github.com/sr320/LabDocs/issues) feature is how we resolve general issues, make purchase request, and identify topics for lab meeting.
