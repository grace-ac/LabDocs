Assessing the Capacity for Evolutionary Adaptation to Ocean Acidification in Geoduck

We are investigating the roles of standing genetic and epigenetic variation in the response to ocean acidification in geoduck. As part of this effort we are also generating a draft genome sequence. This project is funded by the NOAA Ocean Acidification Program.
