His main research interest is the physiological response of aquatic species to environmental change with a particular focus on environmental epigenetics, reproductive biology, and aquaculture. 

A large part of his lab's research acitivity includes analysis of large genomic datasets. In doing this, they practice open notebook science, strive to make all data analysis easily reproducible, and hold open online lab meetings.
