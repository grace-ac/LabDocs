### Sonication
1.	Add 500 µl 6M urea in 50 mM NH4HCO3 (ammonium bicarbonate) to each sample and homogenize larvae using pestle. After homogenization, spin samples down at 2000xg for 5 minutes. 
2. Aliquot 100ul of supernatant to a new tube.
3.	Sonicate each sample for 10s, chilling in ethanol + dry ice for 5s and storing on wet ice between sonications.  Repeat twice for each sample (total of 3 times).
4.	Between samples, rinse the sonicating probe with ethanol and nanopure water.
5.	Store at -80°C if not moving directly to sample digestion.

### Protein quantification – BCA Assay (Pierce)
_This can be done prior to trypsin digestion or in parallel._

Aliquot 11 µl of sonicated sample to a clean tube and add 22 µl NH4HCO3 to dilute urea.  Follow the microplate protocol for BCA using 10 µl of sample and Genn’s dilution curve (below).  Lysis buffer = 50 mM NH4HCO3 with 6M urea diluted 1:2.

|    Vial    |    BSA conc. (µg/µl)    |    Vol. lysis buffer (µl)    |    Vol.   BSA & dilution    |
|------------|-------------------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------|
|    B       |    1.5                  |    125                       |    375,   stock             |

 Use BCA protocol equations to calculate the sample volume containing 100 µg of protein. Make sure to correct for any dilutions.

### Mini-Trypsin digestion

_This digestion is for total starting volume of 100 µl.  You can either aliquot the volume to equal 100 µg of protein to a new tube and add additional 6M urea in 50 mM NH4HCO3 (Step 9 - save remaining lysed cells/proteins in -80°C freezer), or digest your entire sample if it is less than 100 µg protein dissolved in 100 µl total volume._

1. Add 6.6 µl of 1.5 M Tris pH 8.8
2. Add 2.5 µl 200 mM TCEP and vortex
3. Test pH of samples to make sure they are still basic.
4.	Incubate samples 1 hour at 37°C
5.	Add 20 µl of 200 mM iodoacetamide (IAA)
6.	Incubate 1 hour, room temperature, in dark
7.	Add 20 µl 200 mM diothiothreitol (DTT, freshly made or frozen), vortex
8.	Incubate 1 hour, room temperature
9.	Aliquot the volume equal to 100 µg of protein to a new tube (save remainder at -80°C)
10.	OPTIONAL: Add ApoA1 to each sample (dilute 1.1 µl 2200 ng/µl stock in 48.9 µl of 50mM NH4HCO3 to make 50 ng/µl) to make 1:300 ratio of ApoA1:total protein. For 100 µg total protein in a sample, add 333 ng of ApoA1 by adding 6.7 µl of 60 ng/µl ApoA1 solution.
11.	Add LysC at a 1:30 enzyme:protein ratio to each sample. (LysC cleaves at C-terminus of R and K, like trypsin, but works well in 6M urea.)
12.	Incubate 1 hour, room temperature
13.	Add 800 µl 25 mM NH4HCO3 and 200 µl HPLC grade methanol to each tube.
14.	Prepare the number of trypsin bottles needed (you will want 5 µg of trypsin for each sample, or 1 µg trypsin: 20 µg protein).  Add 20 µl water or trypsin buffer to each bottle of trypsin and vortex lightly.  Aliquot 5 µl of trypsin to each sample for 100 µg of sample (1:30 enzyme:protein).
15.	Incubate overnight at room temperature or for 4 hours at 37°C. 
16.	Evaporate samples at 4°C to near dryness on speed vacuum (<20 µl). Store at -80°C.
