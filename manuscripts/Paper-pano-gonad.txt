Abstract
Introduction
The Pacific geoduck, Panopea generosa Gould, 1850, endemic to the eastern Pacific coast and estuaries from 29-57 N latitude (Punta Canoas, Baja California, Mexico to Kodiak Island, Alaska, USA), represents a valuable export fishery for Mexico, USA and Canada, primarily to markets in Asia. To meet demand, mostly from China and Hong Kong, aquaculture production of this valuable clam has increased considerably in Washington State, USA and British Columbia, Canada over the last two decades. As an example, USA aquaculture production has rise from 9 tons in 2000 to a maximum of 727 tons with 24.4 million USD value in 2013 (FAO, 2016[a]). Whereas in British Columbia, Canada, clams aquaculture[b] production has increased from 47 tons in 1990 to 1,327 tons in 2014 (Fisheries and Oceans Canada, 2016[c]). In contrast, in recent years efforts are underway to commercialize geoduck aquaculture in the Baja California peninsula in Mexico, where there are three private hatcheries and two universities producing geoduck juveniles (El Mexicano newspaper, 2015;[d] CESAIBC, 2016[e]).
 
Sustainable fisheries and viable aquaculture production of geoduck clams both rely on effective reproductive output. Reproductive development in bivalve shellfish can be influenced by a number of factors: exogenous factors include temperature regime, primary productivity[f], physiological stressors and depth (e.g. Eversole 1989, Walker & Heffernan 1994). Endogenous influences include body size, basal metabolic rate, genetic and epigenetic factors (CITA?)[g].  The interplay of endogenous and exogenous influences on maturation is an important determinant of species persistence, source-sink relationships, and metapopulation dynamics (CITA?)[h]. Understanding these relationships requires baseline biological information on reproduction. 
 
Despite the economic importance of the Pacific geoduck P. generosa, little is known about its reproductive biology.  Campbell & Ming (2003) characterized age and size at maturation for geoduck in British Columbia, Canada as 2-3 years and ~60 mm in shell length. Among three sites in Washington State, USA, Vadopalas et al. (2015) reported age and size at maturation for males and females as 22 mo, 58 mm and 29 mo, 80 mm, respectively.  In addition, gender ratios in geoduck[i] aged 2-5 years are skewed toward males, the overall male:female ratio of 2.3:1 observed in known age 2–5-y-olds farmed geoduck [j](Vadopalas et al., 2015) is similar yet lower [k]than the ratios reported by Andersen (1971; 17:1), Sloan and Robinson (1984, 9:1) and Campbell & Ming (2003; 12:1) all based on size rather than known age[l].  Both Vadopalas et al. (2015) and Campbell & Ming (2003) reported simultaneous hermaphrodites at an approximate rate of 0.4%. Taken together, these data suggest protandry as postulated by Andersen (1971) and shown for the congener Panopea zelandica by Gribben and Creese (2003).  


Marshall et al. (2012) [m]examined broodstock development of P. generosa over a range of temperatures (7, 11, 15 and 19°C), finding out that clams held at lower temperature displayed a more advanced state of reproductive development than those at the two higher temperatures. Anto to optimized reproductive performance in hatchery reared organisms, clams should be held at 11°C where prolonged spawnings and gamete generation are achieved. In the other hand, higher temperatures (19°C) should be avoided as gonads shown degeneration under this conditions.. Later on, Marshall et al. (2014) evaluated the effect of feed ration on gonadal development of P. generosa, finding an appropriate ration of 4.0×109 cells of Isochrysis sp. and Chaetoceros muelleri (50 : 50 cell count) per clam per day to maximize gamete output over time under hatchery conditions.


A study of biochemical changes during maturation of the congener P. globosa by Arcos-Ortega et al.  (2015) demonstrated a strong correlation of vitellin with maturation in females.   
 
Efforts to understand and characterize maturation in wild populations, as well as to optimize maturation for aquaculture purposes, would benefit from baseline information on gene expression.  Previous work on other bivalves has demonstrated the value of transcriptomic resources. One example is a study using a microarray platform to examine the gonad transcriptome in Crassostrea gigas by Dheilly and coworkers (2012).  In comparing males and females Dheilly et al. identified 77 genes that were sex-specific, which could have practical application in identifying broodstock. Focusing on another important aquaculture species, the European clam (Ruditapes decussatus),  (de Sousa et al., 2015) used a microarray to identify potential biomarkers of oocyte quality. From this work it was determined that chaperones molecules are main determinants of good quality oocytes and genes involved in stress response, including apoptosis, are associated with poor oocyte quality. 


This work[n] generated a transcriptomic resource for Pacific geoduck P. generosa using RNA-seq technology, providing important tools for characterizing the reproductive development of wild populations across the species range, enabling efficiencies in broodstock maturation for aquaculture production of this valuable resource.
 














Methods
RNA-seq Libraries
Based on histological determination of reproductive maturational stage, seven female and six male paraffin-embedded gonad samples were selected for RNA isolation (Crandall and Roberts, 2016). The female samples represented three maturational stages including; stage 1 (No secondary oocytes; or secondary oocytes ~ 5 - 15 µm) ID=fGeo-08; stage 5 (secondary oocytes ~50 - 75 µm) ID=fGeo-34, fGeo-35, fGeo-38; and stage 6 (secondary oocytes ~65 - 85 µm) ID=fGeo-51, fGeo-69, fGeo-70. Males samples represented two maturational stages; stage 1 (~ <5 % spermatids per acinus; small acini) ID=mGeo-02, mGeo-07, mGeo-09 and stage 3 (~50 % spermatids per acinus) mGeo-41, mGeo-42, mGeo-46. RNA was isolated using the PAXgene Tissue RNA Kit (Qiagen) based on manufacturer’s instructions. Sections (5 µm) were collected from paraffin blocks. In lieu of a shaker-incubator indicated in the protocol, the samples were incubated for 15 min at 45 °C in a dry oven using the Disruptor Genie (Scientific Industries). Samples were eluted using 40 µL of Buffer TR4. All RNA samples were quantified using a NanoDrop1000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). RNA integrity was verified on a Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) using either the RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Agilent Technologies) or the RNA 6000 Nano Kit (Agilent Technologies), depending on sample concentration.
Two pools of RNA (male RNA and female RNA) were prepared for RNA-seq. Both pools contained equal quantities of RNA from each maturational stage. Library preparations and sequencing were performed by GeneWiz, Inc. Libraries were constructed using the Ultra RNA Library Preparation Kit (New England Biolabs). Both libraries were sequenced on a single lane of the HiSeq2500 (Illumina) sequencer.
Raw sequence reads were quality trimmed using Trim Galore v0.4.0[o] (Krueger 2013), and quality assessed using FastQC (Andrews 2010). A combined assembly of sequence reads was carried out using Trinity[p] r20131110 (Grabherr et al. 2011) with default parameters. In order to eliminate any possible non-target sequences in the the libraries, a Blastn search (nt database) was carried out and non Eukaryota results (E value <= 1E-20) were removed from further analysis.  TransRate[q] v1.0.1 (reference) was used to assess assembly parameters. 




Transcriptome Annotation
Resulting contigs were compared to the Uniprot/Swiss-Prot protein database using BLASTx with an e-value threshold of 1E-05 and associated Gene Ontology terms identified. Biological Process GO-slim parameters were used in order to summarize annotation. In order to determine the completeness of  the resulting transcriptome, contigs were compared with other transcriptome databases: C. gigas, Gigaton (Riviere et al. 2015), Rup[r]hibase, (Milan et al. 2011) (http://compgen.bio.unipd.it/ruphibase/) using Blastn with an evalue threshold of 1E-10.


Interested particularly on genes involved in reproductive biology, we examined the transcriptome for a previously described gene sets. One suite of genes previously characterized is from Dheilly et al. (2012), where researchers described sex and stage specific genes in C. gigas. To make this comparison, the fasta file corresponding to the Dheilly et al. (2012) study microarray study (available from Olson and Roberts, 2014) was compared to the P. generosa transcriptome using Blastn (E value 1E-60) and SQLShare used to join with Dheilly et al. (2012) supplemental Table 1 (sex-specific genes) and supplemental Table 2 (gametogenesis differential expression).


General differences in gene expression between males and females were detected by mapping reads (CLC Genomics v8.5) from male or female quality trimmed reads to the assembled contigs. A set of contigs were classified as highly expressed in the male library or female library based on the following parameters:  ..at least 200 unique reads mapped a contig and no reads from the other sex was mapped to this contig.[s]


CpG-methods
Germline methylation levels were inferred based on the hypermutability of methylated cytosines, which convert to thymines over evolutionary time. This results in a reduction in CpG dinucleotides, meaning that heavily methylated genomic regions are associated with reduced numbers of CpGs. Thus, methylation patterns that have been inherited through the germline over evolutionary time can be estimated using the ratio of observed to expected CpG, known as CpG O/E. Germline DNA methylation estimated by analysis of CpG O/E is highly correlated with direct assays of methylation (Suzuki 2007, Sarda 2012, Gavery 2013). CpG O/E was defined as:
CpG O/E = (number of CpG / number of C x number of G) x (l2/l-1)
where l is the number of nucleotides in the contig.
Only annotated sequences were used for calculation of CpG O/E to increase the likelihood that sequences were oriented in the 5' to 3' direction.














Microsatellite
Contigs were analyzed with msatcommander (Faircloth, 2008) in order to detect possible microsatellites in P. generosa transcriptome. Search parameters were for di- (8 repeats), tri- (8 repeats), tetra- (6 repeats), penta- (6 repeats) and hexanucleotide (6 repeats), looking only for perfect repeats and for primer design default conditions were used (100-450 segment length, primer size 18-22, Tm 58-62, GC% 30-70).

Results


Assembly
A total of 443,468,476 reads was obtained and the de novo assembly resulted in a total of 153,982 transcript contigs, after removing any non-eukaryotic matched sequences[t], with an average contig length of 660 bp and an N50 value of 1015 bp[u] and a GC content of 37%. Consider comparison based on TransRate[v]. Raw sequence reads from the two libraries (pooled male gonad, pooled female gonad) have been deposited in the NCBI SRA database as project SRP072283. The assembled contigs are available at ???  






Annotation[w]
Of the 153,982 contigs, 22,974 (15%) had similarity with proteins in the Swiss-Prot/Uniprot database, and their corresponding Biological Process Gene Ontology information was obtained[x] for 19, 393 contigs (13%). The most common annotation was to RNA metabolism with 19 %, followed by transport and protein metabolism with 18 and 16 %, respectively (Figure 3). Reproduction annotation based on ontology was less than 1 % of all contigs.

A total of 11823 and 2859 contigs matched the GigaTON and Ruphibase databases representing xxxxxx % [11823/xxx][aa] and 8.77 % [2859/ 32606] of the transcriptomes of C. gigas and R. phillippinarum, respectively. When comparing the  P. generosa transcriptome with previously described gene sets, two contigs were identified as putatively sex-specific based on work in C. gigas (Fig. 5). This includes contig comp142444, analogous to Forkhead box protein L2 and comp137246 with homology to actin, cytoplasmic A3a and comp142462_c1_seq1 analogous to the sperm-associated antigen 6 (involved in sperm motility). $$$need to confirm not non-euk$$$[ab].

Differential Expression[ad]
A total of 148 and 198 contigs[ae] were expressed only in male and female gonads respectively. However, only 36 and 44 contigs were annotated, respectively. Genes include testis-specific serine/threonine-protein kinase 1 and testis-specific kinase 4, which are involved spermatid development and in a signaling pathway during male germ cell development or mature sperm function[af][ag][ah]. 


There were 173 contigs that corresponded to gene identified in C. gigas to be differentially expressed through gametogenesis[ai].




Microsatellites
A total of 1366 microsatellites was found, of which 1330 (97.4 %) were dinucleotide microsatellites (Table 3), and the most common repetition motif was AT. The tetranucleotide microsatellites were the second most common, but only with 1.4% of the total found, and the motifs AAAC and AACC were the most common .Only 13 trinucleotide microsatellites were found and the ATC motif was the most common (61.54). However, primers could be designed for 112  microsatellites, 100 dinucleotide, nine trinucleotide and three tetranucleotide.






Discussion
In recent years and thanks to the development of sequencing techniques has allowed to obtain  several transcriptomic studies on gonads of several bivalves, such as Pinctada margaritifera (Teaniniuraitemoana et al., 2014), Cristaria plicata (Patnaik et al., 2016) Patinopecten yessoensis (Li et al., 2016) and also in gasteropods such as abalone (Valenzuela-Muñoz et al., 2014). These studies focus on the identification of genes involved in reproduction, reproductive regulation, gonad development, sex determination among others. In the present work, we report the transcriptome for Panopea generosa related to male and female gonad tissues. To our knowledge, this is the first reproduction[aj] related transcriptome of this species, and this information would be very useful in other reproduction studies mainly for aquaculture purposes.
High throughput sequencing equipment and technologies produce different number of reads. However, it seems that the number of annotated contigs does not depend on the size of the databases, but it may depend on the number of databases used for comparison and whether or not there is a database similar to the species in concern. The total number of reads in this study was smaller (443,468,476) than the those obtained in P. margaritifera (2,125,798,302) [ak]
The geoduck, P. generosa, does not have a complete genome description, thus a de novo assembling had to be carried out. This may be the reason why the low number of annotated sequences, as well as the use of Swissprot Uniprot reference proteins. When the total number of contigs considered for the transcriptomes of C. gigas and R. phillipinarum (38316 and 32606 respectivelly) the 19, 393 contigs would suggest that about half of the P. geneosa could have been characterized.




Annotation
The most common biological processes in P. yessoensis gonads were a) organic substance metabolic, b) primary metabolic and cellular processes (Li et al., 2016), while in C. plicata were a) cellular, b) metabolic and c) single cell processes (Patnaik et al., 2016). In the case of P. margaritifera the most common biological processes were a) cellular, b) metabolic and biological regulation (Teaniniuraitemoana et al., 2014). However, in P. generosa, there were several differences, because the highest annotation, after removing all other biological and other metabolic processes, transport (18%), RNA metabolism (19%) and protein metabolism (16%) (Fig. 3). Gene expression depends on several factors
 




Sex specific genes. 
Sex determination in bivalves has been studied by several authors (Guo et al., 1998; Hedrick and Hedgecock, 2010). Beside environmental factors, 2-genotype (Guo et al., 1998) and 3-genotype models (Hedrick and Hedgecock, 2010) have been proposed for the Crassostrea gigas sex determination. In the case of P. generosa, further research has to be carried out to elucidate the sex determination and whether the sex-related genes found in this study have a higher roll in this determination or environmental factors are more important. In this study, we used female at stages 1, 5 and 6, while for males we used stages 1 and 3. These conditions could have influenced the number of transcripts [al]
A total of 17 perfect and combined microsatellites loci have described in the GenBank for P. abrupta (=generosa)  (Vadopalas and Bentzen, 2000; Vadopalas et al., 2004) (Kaukinen,K.H., Supernault,J. and Miller,K.M. unpublished), June, 30th, 2016), which have been used for population differentiation (Suárez-Moo et al., 2016; Vadopalas et al., 2004). In this work, we found 112 microsatellites with designed primers, which could be considered for further analysis to check their importance for aquaculture purposes.

[g]reference?
[h]reference?
[i]farmed? wild?
[j]I found it confuse!!
[k]similar yet lower?
2.3:1 similar to 17:1, 9:1 or 12:1
I think looks really lower than....
also you are comparing farmed vs wilds ....
[l]wilds!!!
[m]"In a hatchery setting, P. generosa should be held at a temperature of 11 °C if reproductive output is to be maximized. Lower temperatures (e.g. 7 °C), however, could be used to hold ripe broodstock for extended periods"
[n]introduce the objective of it

[y]This does not make sense .. is reproduction not a Slim annotation.
[z]Yes, it is, but there were so few reproduction genes (9, I think) that they were included in the "other biological processes" category.
[aa]Need to confirm # of GigoTON sequences for this.
[ab]comp142444, comp137246 (something is missing from these two),  comp142462_c1_seq1 are eukaryote.
[ac]This needs consideration - think it might best be in supplemental table.
[ad]I think a volcano plot would be good for this section.
[ae]we should indicate these in a table..
[af]Reference needed for a bivalve or mollusk, the function is from the Uniprot, but it is from mouse.
[ag]The fact that we state how annotation were done, covers this to a degree..
[ah]ok
[ai]are these annotated in a table somewhere?
[aj]Is this true? I have not found other paper(s)
[ak]Still working on this paragraph
