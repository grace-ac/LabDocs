Introduction
The Pacific geoduck, Panopea generosa Gould, 1850, endemic to the eastern Pacific Ocean coast and estuaries from 29-57 N latitude (Punta Canoas, Baja California, Mexico to Kodiak Island, Alaska, USA), represents a valuable export fishery for Mexico, USA and Canada, primarily to markets in Asia, with global production in 2014 exceeding 7000 MT with an approximate value of over 200 million USD[a]. To meet ongoing demand, aquaculture comprises approximately 10% of global production, with approximately 90% grown in Washington, USA (Shamshak and King 2015), Efforts are underway to commercialize geoduck aquaculture in Mexico; three private hatcheries and two universities are currently producing geoduck juveniles on the Baja peninsula (Peñuelas Alarid 2015); (CESAIBC 2016).
 
Sustainable fisheries and viable aquaculture production of geoduck both rely on effective reproductive output. Reproductive development in bivalve shellfish can be influenced by both exogenous factors such as temperature regime, primary productivity (Calderon-Aguilera et al. 2010), physiological stressors and depth (e.g. (Eversole 1989), (Walker and Heffernan 1994)) and endogenous factors such as body size, basal metabolic rate, genetics and epigenetics.  The interplay of endogenous and exogenous influences on maturation is an important determinant of species persistence, source-sink relationships, and metapopulation dynamics. Understanding these relationships requires baseline biological information on reproduction. 
 
Despite the economic importance of the Pacific geoduck, relatively little is known about its reproductive biology.  (Campbell and Ming 2003) characterized age and size at maturation for wild geoduck in British Columbia, Canada as 2-3 years and ~60 mm in shell length, similar to farmed geoduck in Washington State, USA, (Vadopalas et al. 2015).  Vadopalas et al. (2015) reported maturation in females occurs approximately six mo later and at ~20 mm greater length than males. In addition, sex ratios in young, mature Pacific geoduck are skewed toward males (Andersen 1971); (Sloan NA, Robinson SMC 1984); (Campbell and Ming 2003)(Vadopalas et al. 2015) ). As postulated by (Andersen 1971), protandry appears likely in this species given typical ratios for wild Pacific geoduck once recruited to the fishery are approximately 1:1 (Goodwin 1976); the congener P. zelandica is protandric (Gribben and Creese 2003).  


(Marshall et al. 2012) showed increased gametogenesis at lower temperatures (7 and 11 °C), in accord with field studies that observed ripening during winter months with similar water temperatures (Campbell and Ming, 2003, Sloan and Robinson 1984, Goodwin 1976). (Arcos-Ortega et al. 2015) tracked biochemical changes during maturation of the congener P. globosa and demonstrated a strong correlation of vitellin with maturation in females, and identified these chemicals as potential biomarkers of sex and maturation status. 
 
Efforts to understand and characterize maturation in wild populations, as well as to optimize maturation for aquaculture purposes, would benefit from baseline gene expression information.  Previous work on other bivalves has demonstrated the value of transcriptomic resources focused on maturation. (Dheilly et al. 2012) used a microarray platform to examine the gonad transcriptome in male and female Crassostrea gigas, and identified 77 sex-specific genes that have practical application in identifying broodstock. Focusing on another important aquaculture species, the European clam (Ruditapes decussatus), (de Sousa et al. 2015) used a DNA microarray to determine that molecular chaperones are associated with good quality oocytes and genes involved in stress response, including apoptosis, are associated with poor quality oocytes.  Zhang et al. (2014)[b] and Li et al. (2016) compared transcriptomes of bivalve ovaries and testes (from the oyster Crassostrea gigas and the scallop Patinopecten yessoensis, respectively) and found some genes, differentially expressed between sexes in vertebrates, are likewise differentially expressed in C. gigas and P. yessoensis, suggesting the importance of these conserved genes for sex determination.  


Our goal is to contribute a transcriptomic resource for Pacific geoduck using RNA-seq technology, providing important tools for characterizing the reproductive development of wild populations across the species range, and enabling efficiencies in broodstock maturation for aquaculture production of this valuable resource.
Materials and methods
RNA-seq Libraries
Based on histological determination of reproductive maturational stage, seven female and six male paraffin-embedded gonad samples were selected for RNA isolation (Crandall and Roberts 2016a). The female samples represented three maturational stages including; stage 1 (No secondary oocytes; or secondary oocytes ~ 5 - 15 µm) ID=fGeo-08; stage 5 (secondary oocytes ~50 - 75 µm) ID=fGeo-34, fGeo-35, fGeo-38; and stage 6 (secondary oocytes ~65 - 85 µm) ID=fGeo-51, fGeo-69, fGeo-70. Male samples represented two maturational stages; stage 1 (~ <5 % spermatids per acinus; small acini) ID=mGeo-02, mGeo-07, mGeo-09 and stage 3 (~50 % spermatids per acinus) mGeo-41, mGeo-42, mGeo-46, with identification codes corresponding to those reported in (Crandall and Roberts 2016b)   RNA was isolated using the PAXgene Tissue RNA Kit (Qiagen) based on manufacturer’s instructions. Sections (5 µm) were collected from paraffin blocks. In lieu of a shaker-incubator indicated in the protocol, the samples were incubated for 15 min at 45 °C in a dry oven using the Disruptor Genie (Scientific Industries). Samples were eluted using 40 µL of Buffer TR4. All RNA samples were quantified using a NanoDrop1000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). RNA integrity was verified on a Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) using either the RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Agilent Technologies) or the RNA 6000 Nano Kit (Agilent Technologies), depending on sample concentration.
Two pools of RNA (male RNA and female RNA) were prepared for RNA-seq. Both pools contained equal quantities of RNA from each maturational stage. Library preparations and sequencing were performed by GeneWiz, Inc. Libraries were constructed using the Ultra RNA Library Preparation Kit (New England Biolabs). Both libraries were sequenced on a single lane of the HiSeq2500 (Illumina) sequencer.
Raw sequence reads were quality trimmed using Trim Galore v0.4.0 (Krueger, 2015, http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/trim_galore/), and quality assessed using FastQC (Andrews 2010). A combined assembly of sequence reads was carried out using Trinity r20131110 (Grabherr et al. 2011) with default parameters. In order to eliminate any possible non-target sequences in the the libraries, a Blastn search (nt database) was carried out and non Eukaryota results (E value <= 1E-20) were removed from further analysis. TransRate v1.0.1 (Smith-Unna et al. 2016) was used to assess assembly parameters. 


Transcriptome Annotation
Resulting contigs were compared to the UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot protein database using BLASTx with an e-value threshold of 1E-05 and associated Gene Ontology terms identified. Biological Process GO-slim parameters were used in order to summarize annotation. In order to determine the completeness of  the resulting transcriptome, contigs were compared with other transcriptome databases: C. gigas, Gigaton (Riviere et al. 2015), Ruphibase, (Milan et al. 2011) (http://compgen.bio.unipd.it/ruphibase/) using Blastn with an evalue threshold of 1E-10.
Interested particularly on genes involved in reproductive biology, we examined the transcriptome for a previously described gene sets. One suite of genes previously characterized is from (Dheilly et al. 2012), where researchers described sex and stage specific genes in C. gigas. To make this comparison, the fasta file corresponding to the (Dheilly et al. 2012) study microarray study (available from (Olson and Roberts 2014) was compared to the P. generosa transcriptome using Blastn (E value 1E-60) and SQLShare used to join with (Dheilly et al. 2012) supplemental Table 1 (sex-specific genes) and supplemental Table 2 (gametogenesis differential expression).
General differences in gene expression between males and females were detected by mapping reads (CLC Genomics v8.5) from male or female quality trimmed reads to the assembled contigs. A set of contigs were classified as highly expressed in the male library or female library based on the following parameters: at least 200 unique reads mapped a contig and 100-fold less expression reads from the other sex was mapped to this contig.
Enrichment analysis[c] Gene ontology based enrichment analysis was performed on genes a) predominantly expressed in female gonad tissue and b) predominantly expressed in male gonad tissue, using DAVID (what it stands for). Specifically the Swiss-Prot annotation were used and the sex-predominant genes were compares to the complete annotated transcriptome as the background. 


Microsatellite Discovery
Contigs were analyzed with Msatcommander (Faircloth 2008) in order to detect possible microsatellites in P. generosa transcriptome. Search parameters were for di- (8 repeats), tri- (8 repeats), tetra- (6 repeats), penta- (6 repeats) and hexanucleotide (6 repeats), looking only for perfect repeats and for primer design default conditions were used (100-450 segment length, primer size 18-22, Tm 58-62, GC% 30-70).

Assembly
A total of 443,468,476 reads was obtained and the de novo assembly resulted in a total of 153,982 transcript contigs with a mean contig length of 660 bp and an N50 value of 1015 bp and a GC content of 37%. Raw sequence reads from the two libraries (pooled male gonad, pooled female gonad) have been deposited in the NCBI SRA database as project SRP072283. The assembled contigs (Geoduck-transcriptome-v3.fa) are available at https://osf.io/3xf6m/. A total of 153,982 contigs was obtained with 101 Mb and an N50 of 1015 b, GC content of 36% and CpG of a 0.5477. The smallest contig was 201 bp and the largest was 18024 bp.
Annotation
Of the 153,982 contigs, 25,963 contigs were found to have a match with tested databases (Figure 1; supplemental file: Contig-annotations.tab at https://osf.io/3xf6m/ ). A total of 22,974 (15%) had similarity with proteins in the UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot database, and their corresponding Gene Ontology (GO) information was obtained for 21,683 contigs and 21364 PFAM matches. A total of 19,393 (12.59%) contigs were annotated to Biological Processes of GO. Protein similarities were 19.01 % RNA metabolism, 17.93 % transport, 16.42 % protein metabolism and 10.36 % developmental processes (Figure 2).
 A total of 11823 and 2859 contigs matched the GigaTON and Ruphibase databases representing 43.61 % [11823/27108] and 8.77 % [2859/ 32606] of the transcriptomes of C. gigas and R. phillippinarum, respectively. 
        Panopea generosa contigs were also compared to a set of Crassostrea gigas genes that were previously described as 1) sex-specific expressed genes and 2) gene whose expression changed during gonad development (Dheilly et al. 2012) . Two Panopea contigs matched had matches with the 77 genes determined to be sex-specific including comp142444_c0_seq2 Forkhead box protein L2 and comp137246_c1_seq24 Actin, which were more expressed in female and male oysters, respectively (Dheilly et al. 2012). In comparing our contigs with oyster sequences whose expression changed during gonad development in 161 matched including geoduck sequences corresponding to genes expressed in gonads in early gonad developmental stages (7; Dheilly_Cluster 1), with increasing expression during spermatogenesis (44;  Dheilly_Cluster 5-6), with increasing expression during oogenesis (31; Dheilly_Cluster 2-4) and genes with varying expression level during gonadogenesis in both sexes (79; Dheilly_Cluster 7-10)  (supplemental file: Contig-annotaions.tab at https://osf.io/3xf6m/ ).

Gene Expression
        While there are not sufficient samples to properly perform differential gene expression we did identify a suite of genes determined to be highly expressed in either males or females, 171 and 381[f] contigs, respectively. As would be expected, enrichment analyses of contigs highly expressed in males revealed enriched biological processes including intracellular signal transduction (GO:0035556
p<0.02), spermatid development (GO:0007286, p<0.02), and flagellum-dependent cell motility (GO:0001539, p<0.02). Enriched biological processes identified in genes at high levels predominantly in females include homophilic cell adhesion via plasma membrane adhesion molecules (GO:0007156,
 p<0.02), serotonergic neuron axon guidance (GO:0036515,  p<0.02), and dopaminergic neuron axon guidance (GO:0036514,  p<0.02).

Microsatellites
A total of 1366 microsatellites was found, of which 1330 (97.4 %) were dinucleotide microsatellites (Table 3), and the most common repetition motif was AT. The tetranucleotide microsatellites were the second most common, but only with 1.4% of the total found, and the motifs AAAC and AACC were the most common. Only 13 trinucleotide microsatellites were found and the ATC motif was the most common (61.54). However, primers could be designed for 112  microsatellites, 100 dinucleotide, nine trinucleotide and three tetranucleotide.

In recent years and thanks to the development of sequencing techniques has allowed to obtain  several transcriptomic studies on gonads of several bivalves, such as Pinctada margaritifera (Teaniniuraitemoana et al. 2014), Cristaria plicata (Patnaik et al. 2016) Patinopecten yessoensis (Li et al. 2016) and also in gastropods such as abalone (Valenzuela-Muñoz et al. 2012). These studies focus on the identification of genes involved in reproduction, reproductive regulation, gonad development, sex determination among others. In the present work, we report the transcriptome for Panopea generosa related to male and female gonad tissues. To our knowledge, this is the first reproduction[g] related transcriptome of this species, and this information would be very useful in other reproduction studies mainly for aquaculture purposes.
High throughput sequencing equipment and technologies produce different number of reads. However, it seems that the number of annotated contigs does not depend on the size of the databases, but it may depend on the number of databases used for comparison and whether or not there is a database similar to the species in concern. The total number of reads in this study was smaller (443,468,476) than the those obtained in P. margaritifera (2,125,798,302) 
The geoduck, P. generosa, does not have a complete genome description, thus a de novo assembling had to be carried out. This may be the reason why the low number of annotated sequences, as well as the use of UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot reference proteins. When the total number of contigs considered for the transcriptomes of C. gigas and R. phillipinarum (38316 and 32606 respectively) the 19, 393 contigs would suggest that about half of the P. generosa could have been characterized.


Annotation
The most common biological processes in P. yessoensis gonads were a) organic substance metabolic, b) primary metabolic and cellular processes (Li et al. 2016), while in C. plicata were a) cellular, b) metabolic and c) single cell processes (Patnaik et al. 2016). In the case of P. margaritifera the most common biological processes were a) cellular, b) metabolic and biological regulation (Teaniniuraitemoana et al. 2014). However, in P. generosa, there were several differences, because the highest annotation, after removing all other biological and other metabolic processes, transport (18%), RNA metabolism (19%) and protein metabolism (16%) (Fig. 2). Gene expression depends on several factors
 




Sex specific genes. 
Sex determination in bivalves has been studied by several authors (Guo et al. 1998); (Hedrick and Hedgecock 2010). Beside environmental factors, 2-genotype (Guo et al. 1998) and 3-genotype models (Hedrick and Hedgecock 2010) have been proposed for the Crassostrea gigas sex determination. In the case of P. generosa, further research has to be carried out to elucidate the sex determination and whether the sex-related genes found in this study have a higher roll in this determination or environmental factors are more important. In this study, we used female at stages 1, 5 and 6, while for males we used stages 1 and 3. These conditions could have influenced in the number of transcripts related with sex determination and gonad development. However, we were able to find some sex-related genes expressed in females (Vitellogenin-6) and males (). 
Vitellogenin-6 (contig comp144315_c1_seq1) is the precursor of the egg-yolk proteins, which are source of nutrients during embryonic development. Vitellogenin-6 is considered as a female specific gene (Teaniniuraitemoana et al., 2014), however, vitellogenin in other mollusk is not female specific (i. e. abalone, López-Landavery et al. 2017), as it was found to be also expressed in males of P. generosa. 
Dynein heavy chains (chains 1, 3, 6 and 7) were found only in male gonads and  are involved in sperm motility. 
Alpha-scruin, threonine-protein kinase (TSK-1, TSK-2, TSK-5) and sperm-specific protein PL-1 were found overexpressed in  males (males >females).  Alpha-scruin is an actin bundling protein found in the acrosomal sperm process. TSK-1 and 2 are required, during spermatogenesis, “for the transformation of a ring-shaped structure around the base of the flagellum originating from the chromatoid body” (Uniprot description), while TSK-5 may be involved in a signaling pathway during male germ cell development or mature sperm function.         Sperm-specific protein PL-1 is involved in the process of spermatid maturation into spermatozoa. 
Foxl2 (Pmarg-foxl2) has been found genes encoding for proteins involved in female sex differentiation in P. margaritifera. While in P. generosa








A total of 17 perfect and combined microsatellites loci have described in the GenBank for P. abrupta (=generosa)  (Vadopalas and Bentzen 2000); (Vadopalas et al. 2004) (Kaukinen,K.H., Supernault,J. and Miller,K.M. unpublished, June, 30th, 2016), which have been used for population differentiation (Suárez-Moo et al. 2016); (Vadopalas et al. 2004). In this work, we found 112 microsatellites with designed primers, which could be considered for further analysis to check their importance for aquaculture purposes.
